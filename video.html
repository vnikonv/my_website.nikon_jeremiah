                <p>Here you can see me recording a video of my friend's kitten. Her name is Persik and she's a scaredy cat.
                    She didn't let anyone pet her, which is sad, but understandable. :(</p>
                <p>After all, she met four new people that day: myself, Nikita, Roma and Yulya. We were at Kirill's place on a reunion.
                    Three of my ex-classmates were also there. It was a small reunion of close friends.</p>

            <p>It is a video from my faivourite gaming YouTuber. He uploads reviews and summaries of the games I like.
                This one in particular is about a game called "Cruelty Squad".</p>
            <p>The game was developed by Consumer Softproducts led by a Finnish artist Ville Kallio.
                The artstyle, controls and GUI are intentionally bad and uncanny, because the game is set in a biopunk dystopia,
                where immortality has been achieved through artificial revival, thus diminishing the value of human life
                to the point of it becoming negative.</p>
            <p>Mr Re:2D dwells deep into the game's plot, lore, world and development history, focusing on its aesthetical peculiarity
                as well as on its cultural significance. I highly recommend his content; very entertaining indeed.</p>

            <p>SNDK is famous both for his YouTube activity and his contribution to the adaptation of such Western cartoons as
                "Adventure Time", "Gravity Falls" and "Rick and Morty". He needs no further introduction.</p>
            <p>His main passions are animation and voice-acting, so he, alongside a team of independent animators and artists,
                has made quite a few viral videos, including parodies on "Smeshariki", "Three Bogatyrs", "Masha and the Bear", "Fixiki"
                and many other media. Dmitri Karpov was already successful in producing a real cartoon series in partnership with
                Egor Loskutov airing on Kinopoisk, "The What Family". However, "Bad Mascot" is something completely new for SNDK.</p>
            <p>Starting as a pet project, the cartoon made its way into getting a pilot. What I find weird is that the attention
                "Bad Mascot" has received was moderate, compared to SNDK's less serious and energy-consuming videos. Nevertheless,
                what matters is that those people who have seen it enjoyed the experience.</p>
            <p>The cartoon is a story set in a world where mascots could be made into real living creatures. Focky, the main character, is
                one of these mascots. Alas, he got sick of life and of playing his role. That is where the story begins.</p>
