            <h2>Essay<h2>
            <p>I can't remember who I am quite often, lacking a strong sense of self, so I just exist for the sake of existing and fun. Everything about me seems insignificant, yet the world is full of wonders. I have many faces, but none of them is my own. Except for the one you are seeing now; warts and all.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I try doing my best. I have many interests, from world-building and character creation to videogames and fine arts. I mainly work with information, people and feelings. I study new things every day. I put on a decisive smile, because I aim to be cheerful on the inside, remain composed and spread good mood on the outside in spite of adversity. I have a strong will and a wish to guide people towards their individual growth. I want to become a manager in the future.</p>
            <p>The feeling of certainty and the feeling of meaning are two of my most treasured values. Happiness is a resource for actions, therefore it is of secondary importance. Life may be strange and confusing, but when I do find the meaning, I feel alive.</p>
