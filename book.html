            <p>"The Artamonov Business" is a novel by Maxim Gorky. It tells a story of a family of serfs who have been freed after the
                abolition of serfdom. It spans over three generations of that family's outsprings, as the world around them undergoes
                drastic changes.</p>

            <p>"The Little Witch" is a children's book by Otfried Preußler that brings up pleasant memories from my own childhood. The main
                character is a young — about a hundred years old — witch, who wants to become powerful to help the common people. She is kind
                and naive, not knowing what other witches are like. I especially liked the finale.

            <p>"Human, All Too Human" is the first book of Nietzsche that I have read. It tells about things and conclusions that
                are actually not too complicated, lying on the surface even. However, I still managed to get some insights into
                the nature of metaphysics. His way of philosophising (with a hammer) is unorthodox, of which I do approve. Personally,
                I liked it better than "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", partially — due to the style being more comprehensible and less dramatic.</p>
